## 🖐️ About Me
I'm a "hands-on-keyboard" type of guy. I love building web applications and working with APIs. My favorite frameworks are Python Django and NextJS. Development that makes a difference, like at a startup, is what gets me excited. When I'm not writing code, I'm probably reading about wizards, exploring the mountains, or playing games with my friends.

## 📕 Projects
I'm currently working on a [startup](https://github.com/prestondavid99/SandboxLandingPage)!
